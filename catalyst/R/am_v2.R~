#' Perform the interaction/infection step
#'
#' @param inf_indices indices of the currently infected agents
#' @param sus_indices indices of currently susceptible agents
#' @param agent_data a T+1 x N matrix where T+1 is the final time step and N is the number of agents where entry tn = k means that agent n at time t is in state k.
#' @param nbr_list of length N where entry n is a vector of indices of neighbors, that is people who share an environment assignment of non-zero for the same category.  The list entry has a 0 element if it has no neighbors
#' @param tt current time step
#' @param sus_inf_arr a length(sus_states) x length(inf_states) x K array where entry ijk=1 means that an interaction between an agent in susceptible state i can put an agent in infectious state j into state k with non-zero probability.
#' @return Updated agent_probs
